30,1,14,Ross,"Well I uh, I skipped forth grade."
31,2,0,Ross,You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
32,2,1,Rachel,What?
33,2,2,Ross,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
34,2,3,Rachel,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
35,2,4,Ross,The point is I...
36,2,5,Ross,"I don't need this right now, OK."
37,2,6,Ross,"It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy."
38,2,7,Ross,This ship has sailed.

53,3,9,Joey,Why would they take away our keys?

55,4,1,Rachel,"Oh we did, but my mom got us the greatest gift of all."
56,4,2,Ross,A

58,4,4,Ross,"Uh, what?"
59,4,5,Rachel,Yes! She's gonna help us take care of the baby! Woo-hoo.
60,4,6,Ross,WhatYou're not serious.
61,4,7,Ross,"I mean she's a very nice woman, but there is no way we can take eight weeks of her."
62,4,8,Ross,She'll drive us totally crazy.
63,4,9,Mrs. Green,Hi Ross!
64,4,10,Ross,Hi roomie!
65,5,0,Monica,Hey! What did you decide to do about the movie?
66,5,1,Joey,I don't know!
67,5,2,Joey,It's not like it's porn!
68,5,3,Joey,"This is a serious, legitimate movie."
69,5,4,Joey,And the nudity is really important to the story.
70,5,5,Monica,That's what you say about porn.
71,5,6,Joey,You're right. Maybe I shouldn't even go on the call back.
72,5,7,Monica,"No! No you should! A lot of major actors do nude scenes! I mean, the chance to star in a movie? Come on!"
73,5,8,Joey,Well that's true.
74,5,9,Joey,And I am only naked in one scene.
75,5,10,Joey,Plus it sounds really great.
76,5,11,Joey,My character's catholic and he falls in love with this Jewish girl.
77,5,12,Joey,Who run away together and they get caught in this big rainstorm.
78,5,13,Joey,So we go into this barn and undress each other and hold each other.
79,5,14,Joey,It's really sweet and-and tender.
80,6,0,Joey,"Hey, what's up?"
81,6,1,Chandler,"Nothing, Monica and I had a stupid fight."
82,6,2,Joey,"But you're still moving in together, right? Because my ad came out today."
83,6,3,Chandler,"""Wanted. Female roommate, non-smoker, non-ugly."" Nice!"
84,6,4,Joey,Yeah?
85,6,5,Joey,"I just figured y'know, after living with you it'd be an interesting change of pace to have a female roommate, y'know?"
86,6,6,Joey,"Someone I can learn from, someone-someone who's different than me."
87,6,7,Joey,And what's more different than me. A guy who's
88,7,0,Ross,So where are we going next?
89,7,1,Gary,This witness won't return my calls so we're gonna see if we can surprise him coming home.
90,7,2,Chandler,"Sur-surprise him? We're not, we're not gonna make anybody mad are we?"
91,7,3,Joey,"Come on man!  Listen so uh, are you gonna squeeze the perps shoes a little bit before he lawyers up?"
92,7,4,Gary,It's a witness not a perp. And no one talks like that!
93,7,5,Ross,"Yeah, no one talks like that!"
94,7,6,Joey,Oh what? Like your Mr. Cop!
95,7,7,Ross,"Hey, I'm more cop than you two!"
96,7,8,Chandler,How do you figure that?
97,7,9,Ross,"Hello! I'm in the front seat, okay? I'm Gary's partner!"
98,8,0,Phoebe,I guess so.
99,8,1,Rachel,Here you go. Thank you!
100,8,2,Phoebe,"Wait, Rach! Where's the other one?"
101,8,3,Rachel,"Oh what, you-you want both of them?"
102,8,4,Phoebe,"Rachel Karen Green, where's the other earring?!"
103,8,5,Rachel,"Okay, okay, okay, look, just don't freak out, but I kinda lost it."
104,8,6,Rachel,"I know it's in the apartment, but I"
105,8,7,Phoebe,"Well, what am I going to tell Monica? She wants to wear them tonight!"
106,8,8,Rachel,Tell her to wear her own earrings.
107,8,9,Phoebe,These
108,8,10,Rachel,Nooo! Nooooo! You lent me Monica's earrings?! I'm not allowed to borrow her stuff!
109,8,11,Phoebe,Why not?
110,8,12,Rachel,Because I lose her stuff!

120,9,9,Dr. Harad,"All right, he's coming. He's coming!"

122,9,11,Frank,Chandler's a girl!
123,9,12,Chandler,"Oh God, kindergarten flashback."
124,9,13,Frank,They musta read the sonogram wrong.
125,9,14,Frank,"Cause they, 'cause they thought it was a boy, but Chandler's a girl!"
126,9,15,Frank,Chandler's a girl!
127,9,16,Chandler,"Okay, keep saying it!"
128,9,17,Alice,Am I too late?!
129,9,18,Frank,"No-no ah, everything's okay. Everybody's healthy there's 30 fingers and 30 toes."
130,9,19,Alice,We have our babies?
131,9,20,Frank,Yeah.
132,9,21,Alice,"Oh, we have our babies."

138,10,5,Chandler,"Okay Bob listen uhh, I'm the reason you didn't get the job up here."
139,10,6,Bob,Toby don't.
140,10,7,Chandler,Bob!
141,10,8,Bob,Toby! I'm not gonna let you cover for him. Anything you say right now will just get me more upset with Chandler!
142,11,0,Rachel,Thank you.  Oh Joey and look at this crib! It's so cute!
143,11,1,Joey,I know! I found it on the street.

145,11,3,Joey,Yeah.
146,11,4,Rachel,Wow! Whoa-whoa what's under the covers?
147,11,5,Joey,I don't know.
148,11,6,Rachel,It's moving.
149,11,7,Joey,Ew.
150,11,8,Rachel,It's stillIt's got a tail! Get it out of here! Get it out of here!!
151,11,9,Joey,Ooh! Ah! Okay!
152,12,0,Whitney,"Well, I went over to Kyle's last night to pick up a few things and we got to reminiscing"
153,12,1,Kyle,we talked through most of the night and we realized that the reason we were so angry at each other was because there are still feelings there. So
154,12,2,Ross,Oh just say it Kyle!
155,12,3,Kyle,We're gonna give it another try.
156,12,4,Phoebe,What about her whining and her constant need for attention?!
157,12,5,Whitney,I'm gonna work on that.
158,12,6,Phoebe,"Oh right, because you're so capable of change."
159,12,7,Ross,"Y'know, he hums when he pees!"
160,12,8,Whitney,I do know.
161,12,9,Ross,"It makes him miss the bowl, but whatever."
162,12,10,Whitney,We're so sorry.
163,12,11,Ross,"That's all right, we-we don't need you. In fact, hey I'm over it already."
164,12,12,Phoebe,"Yeah, and y'know what? I don't give a tiny rat's ass."
165,12,13,Kyle,"Yeah, we're gonna go."
166,12,14,Ross,"I'm sorry. Ugh, Pheebs, you were, you were right about her. Y'know, she"
167,12,15,Phoebe,"Oh. Y'know, he hums while he does other stuff to."
168,12,16,Ross,"Yeah, we're better off without them."
169,12,17,Phoebe,"And y'know, even if they break up again, you'd better not let him in your sad men's club!"
170,12,18,Ross,Divorced men's club.
171,13,0,Monica,Phoebe!
172,13,1,Phoebe,Yeah?
173,13,2,Monica,Have you seen Chandler?!
174,13,3,Phoebe,No! Why?
175,13,4,Monica,The woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and Chandler heard!
176,13,5,Monica,I know!
177,13,6,Monica,How bad is this?
178,13,7,Phoebe,"Well for the regular guy, it's bad, but Chandler, Oh dear God!"
179,13,8,Monica,I know! I know! And he totally freaked out and I can't find him anywhere!
180,13,9,Phoebe,What are you gonna do?
181,13,10,Monica,"Well, I'm never gonna listen to you again, that's for sure!"
182,13,11,Monica,"""Y'know, harm can it do if you go and put your name down?"""
183,13,12,Phoebe,Rachel said that!
184,13,13,Monica,Well Rachel's not here!
185,14,0,Ross,"Come on, come on."
186,14,1,Ross,"Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit."
187,14,2,Ross,This is all your fault.
188,14,3,Ross,"This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know?"
189,14,4,Ross,"My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
190,14,5,Susan,The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
191,14,6,Ross,"No no no, believe me."
192,14,7,Ross,"No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok?"
193,14,8,Ross,And you know what the funny thing is?
194,14,9,Ross,"When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok?"
195,14,10,Ross,Where does that leave me?
196,14,11,Susan,You get to be the baby's father.
197,14,12,Susan,Everyone knows who you are.
198,14,13,Susan,Who am I?
199,14,14,Susan,"There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day."
200,14,15,Ross,Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
201,14,16,Phoebe,This is so great.
202,14,17,Ross,You wanna explain that?
203,14,18,Phoebe,"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother died, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one."
204,14,19,Phoebe,And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most.
205,14,20,Phoebe,And it's not even born yet.
206,14,21,Phoebe,"It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world."
207,14,22,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, you were fighting."
208,15,0,Joey,"Okay, it's a typical New York City apartment. Two girls are just hanging out."
209,15,1,Monica,"Hi, how are you doing Kelly?"
210,15,2,Rachel,"I'm doing just fine! God, Tiffany, you smell so great!"
211,15,3,Monica,It's my new perfume. Why don't you come closer where you can
212,15,4,Rachel,"Oh, y'know Joey, you are sick!"
213,15,5,Monica,This is disgusting!
214,15,6,Rachel,I'm not reading this!
215,15,7,Joey,What?! Wait-wait-wait! The handsome man was about to enter!!
216,16,0,Chandler,"Well, what?"
217,16,1,Chandler,What?
218,16,2,Chandler,What is it?
219,16,3,Chandler,That she left you?
220,16,4,Chandler,That she likes women?
221,16,5,Chandler,That she left you for another woman that likes women?
222,16,6,Ross,"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
223,16,7,Chandler,Then what?
224,16,8,Ross,My first time with Carol was...
225,16,9,Joey,What?
226,16,10,Ross,It was my
227,16,11,Joey,With Carol?  Oh.
228,16,12,Chandler,"So in your whole life, you've only been with oneoh."
229,16,13,Joey,"Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight!"
230,17,0,Ross,Hi. Where is everybody?
231,17,1,Phoebe,"Oh, it's already closed, Chris gave me the keys to lock up-what is wrong?"
232,17,2,Ross,"My marriage, I think my marriage is um, is kinda over."
233,17,3,Phoebe,Oh no! Why?
234,17,4,Ross,"Cause Carol's a lesbian.  And, and I'm not one. And apparently it's not a mix and match situation."
235,17,5,Phoebe,"Oh my God! I don't believe it! Oh, you poor bunny."
236,17,6,Ross,I'm an idiot.
237,17,7,Ross,"I mean shoulda seen it, I mean Carol and I'd be out and she'd, she'd see some beautiful woman, and, and she'd be Ross y'know look at her, and I'd think, God, my wife is cool!"
238,17,8,Phoebe,"Aw! Hey, do you think that Susan person is her lover?"
239,17,9,Ross,"Well, now I do!!"
240,17,10,Phoebe,I'm sorry.
241,17,11,Ross,Seven years.
242,17,12,Ross,"I mean we've been together seven years, she's the only woman who's ever loved me, and the only woman I've-I've ever...."
243,17,13,Phoebe,"Aw, God Ross. Oh."
244,18,0,Cookie,I'll do it.
245,18,1,Joey,No you won't.
246,18,2,Joey,"Look he knows he did a terrible thing and I believe him, he's sorry."
247,18,3,Joey,"But,  you've got one more apology to make, all right, you've got to apologize to Mary-Angela."
248,18,4,Chandler,"Okay, absolutely!"
249,18,5,Joey,All right.
250,18,6,Chandler,You've got it.
251,18,7,Joey,"Cookie, now you can punch him!"
252,18,8,Chandler,What?!
253,19,0,Monica,Julie.
254,19,1,Rachel,What?!
255,19,2,Monica,Jody!
256,19,3,Rachel,You were with Julie?
257,19,4,Monica,"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend."
258,19,5,Monica,"And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping."
259,19,6,Rachel,Oh. Oh my God.
260,19,7,Monica,"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
261,19,8,Rachel,"Yeah, right.  Sure!"
262,19,9,Monica,"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time."
263,19,10,Monica,"Look, I'm sorry, all right."
264,19,11,Monica,I never meant for you to find out!
265,19,12,Rachel,"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught."
266,19,13,Monica,That is not true!
267,19,14,Rachel,"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
268,19,15,Monica,Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
269,19,16,Rachel,"Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to"
270,20,0,Monica,Yeah!
271,20,1,Phoebe,I can't say.
272,20,2,Monica,Why?!
273,20,3,Chandler,Why not?
274,20,4,Phoebe,I can't say because he's famous.
275,20,5,Rachel,"Oh my God, who is it?!"
276,20,6,Monica,"Phoebe, come on, you have to tell us."
277,20,7,Phoebe,"Okay, okay. It's James Brolin. James Brolin is the father of my baby."
278,20,8,Chandler,As in Barbara Streisand's husband James Brolin?
279,20,9,Phoebe,What?! Well he never said that to me!
280,21,0,Ross,In
281,21,1,Phoebe,"Oh, this life! Oh okay no, Chandler's is worse."
282,21,2,Joey,"Man, it must be so cool remembering stuff like that! I don't have any past life memories."
283,21,3,Phoebe,Of course you don't sweetie. You're brand new.
284,21,4,Rachel,I know Monica's worst Thanksgiving.
285,21,5,Monica,"Oh, let's not tell this story."
286,21,6,All,"Oh, come on!"
287,21,7,Phoebe,"Oh no, I know! I know! It's the one where Joey got Monica's turkey stuck on his head!"
288,21,8,Rachel,What?! Joey got a turkey stuck on his head?!
289,21,9,Joey,"Hey, it's not like it sounds."
290,21,10,Chandler,It's
291,22,0,Monica,"Wendy, we had a deal!  Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy!"
292,22,1,Rachel,Who was that?
293,22,2,Monica,Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
294,22,3,Rachel,Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye.
295,22,4,Monica,Ten dollars an hour.
296,22,5,Rachel,No.
297,22,6,Monica,Twelve dollars an hour.
298,22,7,Rachel,"Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
299,22,8,Monica,"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you."
300,22,9,Monica,"I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour."
301,22,10,Rachel,Done.
302,23,0,Joey,"The reactor's gonna blow in three seconds, we're never gonna make it!"
303,23,1,Phoebe,You've got to get out of here! Save yourself!
304,23,2,Joey,No! I won't leave you!
305,23,3,Phoebe,"Don't worry about me, I'm a robot! I'm just a machine!!"
306,23,4,Joey,No you're not! Not to me!
307,23,5,Phoebe,Oh my God.

310,23,8,Joey,"Yeah, you're great! Okay, let's take it from"
311,23,9,Phoebe,"No, I mean I was really acting my ass off."
312,23,10,Joey,"Yeah, I thought I was pretty good too."
313,23,11,Phoebe,"Oh yeah, you're solid. Yeah, you're just no me."
314,23,12,Joey,Y'know what? I think that's enough for now. Yeah. I don't want to be over rehearsed.
315,23,13,Phoebe,Fine!
316,23,14,Phoebe,I'll do it without you!
317,23,15,Phoebe,I don't need you or anybody else!
318,23,16,Phoebe,I'm gonna make it on my own!
319,23,17,Phoebe,You'll see!!
320,23,18,Phoebe,You'll
321,24,0,Kori,I can't believe that Ross is gone. It is just so sad.
322,24,1,Chandler,I didn't know Ross and you were so close.
323,24,2,Kori,We weren't but we had one class together. He was such a great    guy and he talked so passionately about science. I always remembered him.
324,24,3,Chandler,I'm sure that would mean a lot to him.
325,24,4,Chandler,"And if heaven has a    door, I'm sure he's pressing his ear up against it and listening intently."
326,24,5,Kori,I thought so many times about calling him and asking him out.    I guess I really missed my chance.
327,24,6,Ross,But you didn't!
328,24,7,Ross,I'm still alive!!
329,24,8,Ross,"Kori, I know this is a big surprise for you."
330,24,9,Ross,It's a long story but the things    you just said really made my day!
331,24,10,Ross,"I mean, the fact that you are here means more    to me than if this room were filled with people!"
332,24,11,Kori,"You sick freak, who does that? I can't believe I had a crush on    you!"
333,24,12,Ross,Did you hear that? Kori Weston had a crush on me!!
334,25,0,Dr. Long,We'll do a quick check.
335,25,1,Rachel,Okay.
336,25,2,Dr. Long,"So, eight days late huh?"
337,25,3,Rachel,Yeah.
338,25,4,Dr. Long,You must be a little uncomfortable.
339,25,5,Rachel,"Eh, just a tad."
340,25,6,Dr. Long,"You're about 80 percent effaced, so you're on your way."
341,25,7,Dr. Long,It still could last a little while longer.
342,25,8,Dr. Long,If you're anxious there are a few ways to help things along.
343,25,9,Ross,Do them!!
344,25,10,Dr. Long,"Actually, they're things you can do. Just some home remedies, but in my experience I've found that some of them are quite effective."
345,25,11,Rachel,"Well, we are ready to try anything."
346,25,12,Dr. Long,"Okay, there's an herbal tea you can drink."
347,25,13,Rachel,Okay.
348,26,0,Carol,Anytime you're ready.
349,26,1,Ross,"Ok, ok, here we go."
350,26,2,Ross,"Ok, where am I talking to, here?"
351,26,3,Ross,"I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..."
352,26,4,Carol,Just aim for the bump.
353,26,5,Ross,"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes."
354,26,6,Ross,"You know, I, you know, can't do this."
355,26,7,Ross,"Uh, this is too weird."
356,26,8,Ross,I feel stupid.
357,26,9,Carol,"So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it."
358,26,10,Ross,"Hello, baby. Hello, hello."
359,27,0,Ross,Easy. Easy. You have to go to the hospital. Okay?
360,27,1,Rachel,"Okay, I do."
361,27,2,Ross,Okay.
362,27,3,Rachel,I really do.
363,27,4,Ross,"Okay, I'm gonna get your coat and then I'll-I'll put you in a cab."
364,27,5,Rachel,"Okay. Oh wait, wait-wait, you're not gonna come with me?"
365,27,6,Ross,Of course I am. I just have to make a call.
366,27,7,Rachel,Okay.
367,27,8,Ross,Okay?
368,27,9,Rachel,Thank you.  Oww!!!! God!
369,27,10,Ross,"What?! I wh-, what's wrong?"
370,27,11,Rachel,"I'm sorry, I just can't go to the hospital lookin' like this."
371,28,0,TV Announcer,"Pete Becker is circling the ring now. It looks like, he's just trying to feel him out. Oh, Bruiser is just..."
372,28,1,Chandler,"Run! Run you crazy, rich freak!"
373,28,2,Rachel,"Oh, I can't watch this."
374,28,3,Joey,"Check it out, he's winning!  Pete's winning!"
375,28,4,Monica,Really?!
376,28,5,Joey,No-o-o!!
377,28,6,TV Announcer,"Uh-oh, Bruiser has Becker on the canvas and is going for his favourite area."
378,28,7,All,Oh! Oh!
379,28,8,Phoebe,"Wait, if that's his favourite area, why is he being so mean to it?"
380,28,9,Ross,"Well, this is ironic."
381,28,10,Ross,"Of your last two boyfriends, Richard didn't want to have kids, and from the looks of it, now Pete can't."
382,29,0,Rachel,I thought I was a complete idiot.
383,29,1,Joey,"Hey, I'm with you. He even asked me if I thought you'd go out with him."
384,29,2,Rachel,"Oh! Oh, I think I'm gonna throw up a little bit. What did you say?"
385,29,3,Joey,I said no.
386,29,4,Rachel,What?!
387,29,5,Joey,What? II just figured since you're pregnant you're not gonna be seeing people.
388,29,6,Rachel,"Okay Joey, first of all Kash Ford is not people. Second of all, what did he say when you told him I was pregnant?"
389,29,7,Joey,I didn't tell him. I didn't know if you were telling people. This is back when I thought Kash was still people.
390,29,8,Rachel,"Good-good, don't tell him. Don't tell him. Just have him call me okay?"
391,29,9,Joey,"Rach look, I really don't think that's such a great"
392,29,10,Rachel,"Okay, you go do it! I'll come back to that set! I'll meet more actors! I'll meet em all!"
393,30,0,The Hot Girl,I know. You're the guy who wouldn't chip in for the handyman.
394,30,1,Ross,Nevermind!
395,30,2,The Hot Girl,"No, I-I actually thought it was unfair the way everyone reacted. I mean you had just moved in."
396,30,3,The Hot Girl,Jen.
397,30,4,Ross,"Jen, I know this may sound a little But uh, would you maybe wanna grab a cup of coffee sometime, or"
398,30,5,Jen,Sure! That would be nice.
399,30,6,Ross,Umm?
400,30,7,Jen,Oh! My number is on there.  Give me a call.
401,30,8,Ross,I will give you a call.
402,30,9,Jen,I'll see you later.
403,30,10,Ross,Okay!
404,30,11,Jen,I forgot my paper.
405,31,0,Chandler,"Here we go. Okay, brace yourselves."
406,31,1,Monica,What?
407,31,2,Rachel,Okay.
408,31,3,Monica,Ow!
409,31,4,Phoebe,Aren't you gonna go?
410,31,5,Rachel,No. Thank you.
411,31,6,Monica,"No, Rachel never pees in public restrooms."
412,31,7,Rachel,"Well, they never have any paper in there y'know. So my rule is no tissue, no tuschy.'  Well, if everybody's going."
413,31,8,Phoebe,"No, y'know what don't close it  cause the... keys...are in there."
414,31,9,Chandler,"Oh, no-no-no-no-no-no!!"
415,31,10,Joey,What's going on?
416,31,11,Chandler,My lighter's in there!
417,32,0,Rachel,I promise.
418,32,1,Phoebe,"Although, don't feel like you can't visit."
419,32,2,Joey,"Hey, is, is, is Chandler here?"
420,32,3,Ross,"No, no he's not."
421,32,4,Monica,"You guys, Joey just saw Janice kissing her ex-husband."
422,32,5,Ross,"What?  So what are you going to do? I mean how, how are you going to tell Chandler?"
423,32,6,Joey,"Well, I was thinking about that and I, I think the best way would be, to not."
424,32,7,Rachel,"Joey, you can't keep this to yourself, if you know about this, you have to tell him."
425,32,8,Joey,"It'll kill him. I mean it'll, it'll just kill him."
426,32,9,Phoebe,"Well, you could wait til I go to the dentist, maybe"
427,33,0,Carol,"Hey, what are you doing here?"
428,33,1,Ross,"Well, oh just ah, I was just wondering, when you and I split up, did you get the tape that was half the last episode of"
429,33,2,Carol,"Ah yeah, but now it's Susan and me in Mexico and the hostages coming home."
430,33,3,Ross,Where's Ben?
431,33,4,Carol,He's sleeping.
432,33,5,Ross,"Ahh.  Ooh, is this a ah, is this a bad time?"
433,33,6,Carol,"Umm, yeah, actually, Susan's gonna be home any minute, it's kinda an anniversary."
434,33,7,Ross,"Oh! I thought you guys got married in uh, January?"
435,33,8,Carol,It's not that kind of anniversary.
436,33,9,Ross,Ah!  Oh.
437,33,10,Carol,Sooo!! Anyway...
438,34,0,Monica,Where are we gonna find a tiny little hat?
439,34,1,Rachel,"Oh, oh, oh, I'll get Rainy Day Bear'!!"
440,34,2,Monica,"Because he'll know what to do?  Oh my God, you're a genius!"
441,34,3,Rachel,"Oh God, oh God, it's sowed on though."
442,34,4,Monica,Give it. Give it.
443,34,5,Rachel,Okay.
444,34,6,Monica and Rachel,Oh!!
445,34,7,Rachel,"Oh, it's just like a bloodbath in here today."
446,35,0,Joey,"Really? In the moment, I really wanted to kiss you too. In the moment."
447,35,1,Janine,"In the moment, yeah."
448,35,2,Joey,But only in the moment. So do ya wanna kiss again?
449,35,3,Janine,"Sure, New Year's Eve is only two weeks away. Can you wait?"
450,35,4,Joey,No.
451,35,5,Janine,Me neither.
452,35,6,Joey,"3, 2,"
453,35,7,Janine,"Joey, you don't have to count down every time we kiss."
454,35,8,Joey,"Uh, yeah, okay. Except I sorta felt like I needed a couple of seconds to get ready."
455,36,0,Monica,Alright. Phoebe?
456,36,1,Phoebe,"Okay, okay."
457,36,2,Phoebe,"If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!"
458,36,3,Ross,"Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?"
459,36,4,Chandler,"Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever."
460,36,5,Rachel,"See, there's always one guy.  ""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."""
461,36,6,All,"Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy."
462,36,7,Monica,"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?"
463,36,8,Joey,Probably kill myself!
464,36,9,Monica,..Excuse me?
465,36,10,Joey,"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!"
466,36,11,Ross,"Joey, uh-"
467,36,12,Joey,You
468,37,0,Stage Manager,"Joey, onstage!"
469,37,1,Joey,Well can you at least stay to the end of the play?
470,37,2,Joey,"I mean, I'll go to the airport with ya, I-I wanna say good bye."
471,37,3,Lauren,Where are you Vic?
472,37,4,Kate,Flight's in an hour. I-I gotta go.
473,37,5,Lauren,Vic! Vic!
474,37,6,Joey,In a minute!!
475,37,7,Lauren,So this is it? Victor?
476,37,8,Joey,"Yeah, I guess it is."
477,37,9,Joey,"Listen, I ah, I gotta say good bye, and-and I gotta say it quick cause this is killing me."
478,37,10,Joey,"One thing you gotta know, is that I will never forget you."
479,37,11,Joey,"But, you've got things you have to do now, and so do I."
480,37,12,Joey,"And so I'm gonna get on this spaceship,  and I'm gonna go to Blargon 7 in search of alternative fuels."
481,37,13,Joey,"But when I return, 200 years from now, you'll be long gone."
482,37,14,Joey,But I won't have aged at all.
483,37,15,Joey,"So you tell your great-great-granddaughter to look me up, because Adrienne, baby, I'm gonna want to meet her."
484,37,16,Lauren,"So long, Vic!"
485,38,0,Rachel,Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is
486,38,1,Phoebe,"See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on"
487,38,2,Rachel,"What song was that, Pheebs?"
488,38,3,Phoebe,Hi Monica!
489,38,4,Ross,Hey Mon!
490,38,5,Rachel,Hey Mon!
491,38,6,Phoebe,"Oh my God, has she slept at all?"
492,38,7,Ross,Nope.
493,38,8,Rachel,"No, it's been three nights in a row."
494,38,9,Ross,"Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so."
495,38,10,Phoebe,"Oh, okay that explains it."
496,38,11,Phoebe,"I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum."
497,38,12,Phoebe,But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call.
498,39,0,Chandler,"So uh, man, are you gonna go to the play with me tonight?"
499,39,1,Ross,"Y'know what, I don't know how comfortable I am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend."
500,39,2,Chandler,"Yeah, I know but"
501,39,3,Ross,"Oh no-no-no, I'm there."
502,39,4,Monica,Hey!
503,39,5,Joey,Hey Mon! Want some pancakes?
504,39,6,Monica,You made pancakes?
505,39,7,Joey,Yep! Grab a plate.
506,39,8,Joey,"No-no, stay right there.  Gettin' closer."
507,39,9,Chandler,"Okay, okay, but don't worry, because we also have cereals, muffins, waffles,"
508,39,10,Joey,"Listen also we're uh, we're watching the game here Saturday night, if people want to come over."
509,39,11,Ross,Oh yeah!
510,40,0,Ross,"and then, we could've gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar!"
511,40,1,Rachel,"Ross, it just wouldn't have been feasible."
512,40,2,Ross,But having a dove place the ring on your finger would've been no problem?
513,40,3,Rachel,It was really fun being married to you tonight.
514,40,4,Ross,"Yeah! And! And, it was the easiest 400 bucks I've ever made."
515,40,5,Rachel,"Okay Ross, can I uh, can I ask you something?"
516,40,6,Ross,Yeah.
517,40,7,Rachel,"That proposal, at the planetarium"
518,40,8,Ross,"I know, I know it was stupid."
519,40,9,Rachel,Are you kidding?!
520,40,10,Rachel,"With the, with the lilies, and-and the song, and the stars!"
521,40,11,Rachel,It wasreally wonderful!
522,40,12,Rachel,Did you just make that up?
523,40,13,Ross,"No, actually I thought about it when, when we were going out."
524,40,14,Ross,"It's how I imagined I uh, I would ask you to marry me."
525,40,15,Rachel,"Well, that would've been very hard to say no too."
526,40,16,Ross,"It's a good thing I didn't do it, because it sounds like it would've been a very expensive wedding.  Okay, good night"
527,40,17,Rachel,Goodnight
528,40,18,Ross,Even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn't get messed up?
529,40,19,Rachel,I will think about it.
530,40,20,Ross,That's all I'm askin'
531,41,0,Rachel,And that's I'm so glad there's no problem.
532,41,1,Joanna,"That's fine, actually I'm on the hiring committee, so there'll be at least one friendly face."
533,41,2,Rachel,Ohh! That's great!
534,41,3,Joanna,"You know, Junior Miss is where I started. Oh, I had to sleep with the"
535,41,4,Rachel,Really?!
536,41,5,Joanna,No-ho-ho!
537,41,6,Joanna,Yeah.
538,41,7,Joanna,"I mean, no-no-no-no-no, don't you worry, I'm sure with your qualifications you won't need to sleep with some guy to get that job."
539,41,8,Joanna,"Although, I might need some convincing."
540,41,9,Rachel,"Well, I, umm"
541,41,10,Joanna,"Kidding! God, I feel wild today!"
542,42,0,Rachel,Hey!
543,42,1,All,Hi! Hey!
544,42,2,Rachel,Do you guys know any cute guys?
545,42,3,Chandler,"Well, of course I do! My good friend Joey over here."
546,42,4,Joey,"Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you Chandler."
547,42,5,Rachel,"Anyway, there's this big charity ball this weekend and Ralph Lauren bought a table, so I kinda have to go"
548,42,6,Monica,What's the charity?
549,42,7,Rachel,"I don't know, something either trees or diseaseRalph mumbles a lot."
550,42,8,Monica,Does Ralph mumble when you're not paying attention?
551,42,9,Rachel,Yeah! It's weird. But the thing is need to find a date.
552,42,10,Phoebe,"Well, what kind of guy are you looking for?"
553,43,0,Rachel,Hey!
554,43,1,Ross,What are you guys doing later?
555,43,2,Phoebe,"Oh, Rachel and I have appointments to get our hair cut."
556,43,3,Rachel,We do?
557,43,4,Phoebe,I want to see what he wants first.
558,43,5,Ross,I just found out that Elizabeth's dad wants to meet me.
559,43,6,Chandler,"Wait a minute, hold the phone! You're not Elizabeth's dad?!"
560,43,7,Ross,"Come on guys, I-I really want this guy to like me."
561,43,8,Ross,It-it would really help me out if you guys were here to make me look good.
562,43,9,All,Of course we'll help! Yeah! We'll be here!
563,43,10,Ross,Thanks!
564,43,11,Monica,We know how tough those parent/teacher conferences can be.
565,44,0,Rachel,"Oh, hi! How are you doing?"
566,44,1,Tag,I'm okay. I gotta go down to the police station and look at mug shots.
567,44,2,Tag,"Thanks for having me over, you guys."
568,44,3,Ross,Tag?
569,44,4,Ross,Y-You're going?
570,44,5,Ross,"Uh we didn't, uh we didn't get the chance to talk."
571,44,6,Ross,"Uh, so, where did you say you're from again?"
572,44,7,Tag,Colorado.
573,44,8,Ross,"Ah, what good are you."
574,44,9,Rachel,"Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace."
575,44,10,Tag,Okay.
576,44,11,Rachel,"Ah, I-I never should have said what I said."
577,44,12,Rachel,Ity'know what?
578,44,13,Rachel,It just doesn't matter how I feel.
579,44,14,Rachel,"I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay?"
580,44,15,Tag,"Um, I'm not."
581,44,16,Rachel,"Oh, god, I knew it, that I freaked you out."
582,44,17,Tag,"No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us."
583,44,18,Rachel,Really?
584,44,19,Tag,"Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this."
585,45,0,Phoebe,"Tiger!  Dragon! Iceberg!!  Joseph, did you even study at all last night?"
586,45,1,Joey,"Yes! Yes, I did."
587,45,2,Phoebe,Then do Iceberg!
588,45,3,Joey,G-sharp.
589,45,4,Phoebe,G
590,45,5,Joey,What?! I didn't touch a guitar!
591,45,6,Phoebe,"No, but you're questioning my method!"
592,45,7,Joey,"No, I'm not questioning it, I'm saying it's stupid!  What?!"
593,45,8,Monica,Thank you.
594,45,9,Phoebe,Y'know none of my other student thought I was stupid.
595,45,10,Joey,"Your other student, was you!"
596,45,11,Phoebe,"Yeah, well, y'know maybe you just need to try a little harder!"
597,45,12,Joey,"Look, maybe I need to try a real teacher!"
598,45,13,Joey,Right here!
599,45,14,Joey,Here!
600,45,15,Joey,"Andy Cooper, he teaches guitar and look ooh, there's a nice picture of him with a little kid and"
601,45,16,Phoebe,Fine! You go learn from your qualified instructor! But don't come crying to me when everyone's sick and tired of hearing you play
602,45,17,Rachel,"""Baddest man in the whole damn town."""
603,45,18,Phoebe,"Oh, fine! Take his side!"
604,46,0,Rachel,Hi!
605,46,1,Ross,Hi.
606,46,2,Rachel,"Hi.  Umm, I think there's something that we really need to talk about."
607,46,3,Ross,"I think we do. Why don't we go inside?  Look uh, I know why you're here."
608,46,4,Rachel,You do?
609,46,5,Ross,"Yeah, and to save you from any embarrassment umm, I think maybe I should talk first."
610,46,6,Rachel,Okay.
611,46,7,Ross,"Okay.  Uh, Ross and Rachel. Rachel and Ross. That's been one heck of a see-saw hasn't it?"
612,46,8,Rachel,What?
613,46,9,Ross,"I mean look, that-that one night we had was fun andand certainly passionate, but don't you think it's better if we just stayed friends?"
614,46,10,Rachel,Seriously. What?!
615,46,11,Ross,Okay.
616,46,12,Ross,Okay.
617,46,13,Ross,Y'know what?
618,46,14,Ross,"If you want to, we can do it one more time."
619,46,15,Ross,I mean I'd-I'd be okay with that.
620,46,16,Ross,"In fact, I have some time right now."
621,46,17,Rachel,"Okay, y'know what? Can I, can I talk now?"
622,46,18,Ross,Oh sure.
623,46,19,Rachel,"I'm pregnant.  Ross?  Ross?  Okay, whenever you're ready.  And you're the father by the waybut you got that"
624,47,0,Chandler,I know!
625,47,1,Ross,"Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go."
626,47,2,Chandler,Okay.
627,47,3,Ross,Okay.
628,47,4,Chandler,"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
629,47,5,Ross,Hmph.
630,47,6,Chandler,"And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her."
631,47,7,Chandler,"And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place...."
632,47,8,Ross,"With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!"
633,47,9,Chandler,"I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head."
634,47,10,Chandler,"And your like 'Mom, get outta here!'"
635,47,11,Chandler,"You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing."
636,47,12,Chandler,"So it's kinda like, you're, you know."
637,47,13,Chandler,You know.... You don't know!
638,47,14,Ross,"Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?"
639,47,15,Chandler,You said...
640,47,16,Ross,I said '
641,48,0,Phoebe,Oh!
642,48,1,Ross,Look at Emma!
643,48,2,Phoebe,"I just can't decide who she looks more alike, you or Rachel?"
644,48,3,Ross,"Oh what are you kidding? She's gorgeous, it's all Rachel."
645,48,4,Phoebe,"I'm sorry, for the last time, why aren't you two together again?"
646,48,5,Phoebe,"No, I know."
647,48,6,Phoebe,"I know, because you're not in that place."
648,48,7,Phoebe,"Which would be fine, except you totally are."
649,48,8,Ross,It'sit's complicated okay?
650,48,9,Phoebe,"Yeah that's true. Yeah, you love her. You always have. You have a child together. There is no right answer."
651,48,10,Ross,"Look, we've been together."
652,48,11,Ross,Okay?
653,48,12,Ross,"And then apart, and then together, and then apart, and now we have a baby."
654,48,13,Ross,It's just if-if we got together again and it didn't work outI could never do that to Emma.
655,48,14,Ross,I mean she-she thinking everything Oh that'snow me.
656,48,15,Ross,What do they put something in the water in this place?
657,48,16,Ross,"Since Rachel and I we're doing really, we're doing really well right now."
658,48,17,Phoebe,"I know. I know. I know. I know, and if you try to make it more you might wreck it."
659,48,18,Ross,"Yeah, exactly."
660,48,19,Phoebe,Right.  Or you might get everything you've wanted since you were fifteen.
661,49,0,Rachel,God. I forgot how much I love driving. I have
662,49,1,Ross,You don't have a
663,49,2,Rachel,"Oh Ross you're so tense! You just gotta relax, okay? Just need to relax all right? Just need to relax"
664,49,3,Ross,What-what are you doing?! Are youOkay that's not funny! Just stop horsing around!
665,49,4,Rachel,"I am not horsing around, okay? I am Porsching around."
666,49,5,Rachel,Uh-oh.
667,49,6,Ross,"Okay, stay calm. Nothing is going to happen to you, you are not in that much trouble."
668,49,7,Rachel,Really? You think so?
669,49,8,Ross,I was talking to myself! You're going down!
670,50,0,Monica,Hey honey! I missed you today!
671,50,1,Chandler,"Oh, yeah?"
672,50,2,Monica,Yeah.  What d'you wanna do tonight?
673,50,3,Chandler,"Oh, well... Maybe we could..."
674,50,4,Monica,"Ok, trying to turn me on by making a mess?"
675,50,5,Monica,Know your audience!
676,50,6,Monica,"Besides, tomorrow we're doing those fertility tests and until then you need    to keep your tadpoles in the tank."
677,50,7,Chandler,We really need to take those tests?
678,50,8,Monica,"Honey, we've been trying to have a baby for over a year."
679,50,9,Monica,I think    it's a good idea to find out if everything's ok. Just a few routine tests.
680,50,10,Chandler,But I don't wanna do it in a cup!
681,51,0,Phoebe,"Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?"
682,51,1,Max,No. Have you seen David?
683,51,2,Phoebe,"No, no, he hasn't been around."
684,51,3,Max,"Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk."
685,51,4,Phoebe,Minsk?
686,51,5,Max,Minsk. It's in Russia.
687,51,6,Phoebe,I know where Minsk is.
688,51,7,Max,"We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid."
689,51,8,Phoebe,"So when, when do you leave?"
690,51,9,Max,January first
691,52,0,Joey,Pretty great! Except I did get a little attitude from the robot.
692,52,1,Chandler,"Damn those robots, they're supposed to be our"
693,52,2,Joey,"Anyway, it wasn't the robot, it was the guy who controls him."
694,52,3,Joey,"Yeah, he doesn't like me."
695,52,4,Joey,He had C.H.E.E.S.E.
696,52,5,Joey,knock over the sandwich right when I was reaching for one!
697,52,6,Joey,Ohh!
698,52,7,Phoebe,"Well, why don't you just get him fired?"
699,52,8,Joey,"I may have to, I hate to do it, but I'm the star!"
700,52,9,Joey,Y'know?
701,52,10,Joey,There's a limit to how many sandwiches I can eat off the floor.
702,52,11,Joey,Excuse me.
703,52,12,Joey,Joey Tribbiani.
704,52,13,Estelle,"Joe! I'm glad I found ya, I got an audition for ya!"
705,52,14,Joey,Wow!
706,52,15,Estelle,The thing is it's kinda on the Q.T.
707,52,16,Estelle,The actor who has the part doesn't know he might be fired.
708,52,17,Estelle,"It's the lead in a series, Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E."
709,52,18,Joey,I'm the lead in Mac and C.H.E.E.S.E.!!
710,53,0,Monica,Oh good God! If you want a baby so bad just go steal it!
711,53,1,Monica,What is going on with you? Since when are you so crazy about babies?
712,53,2,Chandler,I'm not crazy about babies. I'm crazy about us.
713,53,3,Monica,What?
714,53,4,Chandler,"Look, we've always talked about having babies someday."
715,53,5,Chandler,"I'm not saying it has to be right now, but I'm starting to think that we can handle it."
716,53,6,Chandler,We're good.
717,53,7,Chandler,We're really good.
718,54,0,Monica,"Oh, did you catch him?!"
719,54,1,Ross,Wh-what did he say?!
720,54,2,Phoebe,"He said, ""Nice to meet you Glenda.""  Well, obviously I couldn't give him my real name?"
721,54,3,Rachel,Why?! Why not?!
722,54,4,Phoebe,"Come on, you saw the way he ran out of here!"
723,54,5,Phoebe,He's gonna stick around and talk to the daughter he abandoned!
724,54,6,Joey,What did you say to him?
725,54,7,Phoebe,"Well, I said, I told him y'know, that I was the executor person of Francis' will and that I needed to talk to him so I'm gonna meet him at the coffee house later."
726,55,0,Rachel,"Oh yeah, sure."
727,55,1,Rachel,"Okay, in about ten seconds you're gonna see him kiss me."
728,55,2,Ross,And in about five seconds you're gonna see why.
729,55,3,Rachel,Ross did I ever tell you about the time that I went backpacking through Western Europe?
730,55,4,Rachel,"Okay, get ready to see some beggin'!"
731,55,5,Phoebe,"Oh, you came on to Ross!"
732,55,6,Rachel,What?!
733,55,7,Ross,Now I'm so happy.
734,55,8,Rachel,What are you talking about?!
735,55,9,Monica,You used the Europe story!
736,55,10,Chandler,That's the magic story you use when you wanna have sex!
737,55,11,Rachel,How do you know about that story?!
738,55,12,Joey,How do
739,55,13,Rachel,I heard it from my friend Irene who heard it from some guy!
740,55,14,Joey,Some guy!!
741,55,15,Rachel,"No. No, she told me his name was Ken Adams."
742,55,16,Joey,Ken Adams!!
743,56,0,Joey,Ben!
744,56,1,Chandler,"Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord."
745,56,2,Joey,Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait!
746,56,3,Monica,Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts?
747,56,4,Doctor,"No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here  is the puncture wound from your ring."
748,56,5,Ross,"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry."
749,56,6,Ross,Sorry.
750,56,7,Ross,Sorry!
751,56,8,Ross,I got my s's back!
752,56,9,Ross,Which we can celebrate later.
753,56,10,Ross,Celebrate.
754,57,0,Phoebe,"I licked my arm, what?"
755,57,1,Ross,It's breast milk.
756,57,2,Phoebe,So?
757,57,3,Rachel,"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
758,57,4,Joey,What is the big deal?
759,57,5,Chandler,What did you just do?
760,57,6,Ross,"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
761,57,7,Phoebe,You won't even taste it?
762,57,8,Ross,No!
763,57,9,Phoebe,Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
764,57,10,Ross,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
765,58,0,All,Aww!
766,58,1,Ross,"Hey Pheebs, could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet?"
767,58,2,Phoebe,Oh sure!  Noo!
768,58,3,Rachel,Ohh!!
769,58,4,Ross,My apothecary table!!!
770,58,5,Phoebe,What?!
771,58,6,Rachel,Noooooo!!
772,58,7,Phoebe,"Ross, where did you get this?!"
773,58,8,Rachel,"Oh my God, Phoebe,"
774,58,9,Phoebe,"Wow! Oh my God, well if they've ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars!"
775,58,10,Phoebe,Well this doesn't even smell like opium.
776,58,11,Ross,"Of course not, it smells like wine, which you spilled! And thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way."
777,59,0,Rachel,How is she?
778,59,1,Phoebe,"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
779,59,2,Ross,How's the hair?
780,59,3,Phoebe,"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good."
781,59,4,Phoebe,"I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
782,59,5,Joey,Can we see her?
783,59,6,Phoebe,"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, why don't you come on in."
784,59,7,Joey,How're you doing?
785,60,0,Chandler,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
786,60,1,Carol,"Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it."
787,60,2,Ross,That would be no.
788,60,3,Phoebe,Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
789,60,4,Joey,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh..."
790,60,5,Susan,Cantaloupe juice.
791,60,6,Joey,Exactly.
792,60,7,Ross,You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
793,60,8,Susan,Uh huh.
794,60,9,Ross,"Oh, you've tasted it."
795,60,10,Susan,"You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true."
796,60,11,Ross,Gimme the bottle.  Gimme the towel.
797,61,0,Monica,I still don't get why Greg and Jenny would give us a fake number.
798,61,1,Joey,"Y'know, if they knew what they were doing they probably didn't give you real names either."
799,61,2,Monica,"Okay, maybe people give out fake numbers, but they don't give out fake names."
800,61,3,Joey,"Oh yeah?  Hi, Ken Adams, nice to meet you."
801,61,4,Phoebe,Regina Philange.
802,61,5,Chandler,"I still don't get it, we didn't do anything wrong."
803,61,6,Monica,"I know! Although, you did tell an awful lot of jokes."
804,61,7,Chandler,I thought you said those jokes were funny. Joke! Joke! Joke!
805,61,8,Monica,Joke. Joke. Blah! Blah!
806,61,9,Chandler,Well maybe it was all of your questions.
807,61,10,Monica,What about my questions?
808,62,0,Monica,"Look at it! Ohhh! Wallpaper's a little faded, that's okay. Carpet's a little loose. Hardwood floors!!"
809,62,1,Phoebe,Hey!
810,62,2,Chandler,Hello.
811,62,3,Phoebe,Oh! Ooh! Oh Monica! It's so beautiful.
812,62,4,Monica,I know!!!
813,62,5,Phoebe,"So, I'm here, ready to play."
814,62,6,Monica,Okay.
815,62,7,Phoebe,"I brought a bunch of stuff for the house, so check it out. Ha-ha."
816,62,8,Monica,What's this?
817,62,9,Phoebe,"That's a dog, every house should have a dog."
818,62,10,Monica,Not one that can pee on the roof.
819,62,11,Phoebe,"Well, maybe it's so big because the house was built on radioactive waste."
820,62,12,Chandler,And is this in case the house sneezes?
821,62,13,Phoebe,"No, no, that's the ghost for the attic."
822,62,14,Monica,I don't want a ghost.
823,62,15,Phoebe,"Well, nobody wants a ghost. But you've got one, because the house is sitting on an ancient Indian burial ground."
824,62,16,Ross,"Wait a minute, the house was built on radioactive waste, and an ancient Indian burial ground? That would never happen."
825,62,17,Phoebe,"Okay, obviously you don't know much about the U.S. government."
826,62,18,Rachel,Hey!
827,62,19,All,Hello.
828,62,20,Rachel,I need to talk to you!
829,62,21,Ross,"Sure, what's up?"
830,63,0,Monica,"Hey, guys, guys, did you see my new, china cabinet?!"
831,63,1,Ross and Rachel,Uh-huh.
832,63,2,Phoebe,"Watch, watch."
833,63,3,Ross and Rachel,Ooohhhh!!
834,63,4,Phoebe,"And, and!"
835,63,5,Ross and Rachel,Ahhhh!!
836,63,6,Chandler,"Hey, my Father's house does that!"
837,63,7,Rachel,"O-o-o-okay, how did it go? Tell me everything."
838,63,8,Chandler,"Well, the movie was great, dinner was great, and there's nothing like a cool, crisp New York evening."
839,64,0,Chandler,"Oh-oh, I'm a duck! I go, ""Quack, quack!"" I'm happy all the time!"
840,64,1,Chandler,Nice try.
841,64,2,Monica,"Wait, wait, wait!"
842,64,3,Chandler,"Look, Monica"
843,64,4,Monica,Look!
844,64,5,Chandler,This is not going to work.
845,64,6,Monica,I bet this will work!
846,64,7,Chandler,You are so great! I love you!
847,64,8,Monica,What?
848,64,9,Chandler,"Nothing! I said, I said ""You're so great"" and then I just, I just stopped talking!"
849,64,10,Monica,You said you loved me! I can't believe this!
850,64,11,Chandler,No I didn't!
851,64,12,Monica,"Yes, you did!"
852,64,13,Chandler,No I didn't!
853,64,14,Monica,You love me!
854,64,15,Chandler,No I don't! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
855,65,0,Monica,Hello Greg?
856,65,1,Monica,"Hi, this is Monica from the plane?"
857,65,2,Monica,"Listen, the number that you gave me 853-5   That is their old number!"
858,65,3,Monica,Jenny's been giving it out since they moved!
859,65,4,Chandler,Jenny! That is so Jenny!
860,65,5,Monica,"Hey listen umm, how would you like to get together?"
861,65,6,Monica,Say next Saturday?
862,65,7,Monica,"Okay, how about Sunday?"
863,65,8,Monica,"Okay umm, the week after that?"
864,65,9,Monica,The week after that?
865,65,10,Monica,Y'know what Greg?
866,65,11,Monica,"We are good, interesting, funny people with"
867,66,0,Joey,Ross! Get a shot of this. (He's carrying an issue of the
868,66,1,Phoebe,"Oh, okay, I'm having another one!"
869,66,2,Phoebe,"This one doesn't hurt eitherOoh, yes it does!"
870,66,3,Phoebe,Ow!
871,66,4,Phoebe,Ow!
872,66,5,Phoebe,Ow!
873,66,6,Phoebe,Ow!
874,66,7,Phoebe,Ooh!
875,66,8,Phoebe,"Oh, I was kinda hoping that was it."
876,66,9,Ross,"Hey, where are Monica and Rachel anyway?"
877,66,10,Frank,"Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye!  Hi!"
878,66,11,Rachel,Hi!
879,66,12,Frank,"That was Alice's mom, she said she left five hours ago. She should be here by now!"
880,66,13,Rachel,"Oh, honey, don't worry. She's gonna make it on time."
881,66,14,Frank,Yeah.
882,67,0,Monica,I guess I set up the video camera to try and entice Joey.
883,67,1,Joey,But sadly I could not be enticed.
884,67,2,Ross,Unbelievable! I mean you really kept Joey's underwear?! Why? Why would you do that?!
885,67,3,Monica,I'm Monica. I'm disgusting. I stalk guys and keep their underpants.
886,67,4,Joey,"Well, I think we've all learned something about who's disgusting and who's not."
887,67,5,Joey,Eh?
888,67,6,Joey,"All right, now, I'm going to get back to my bucket."
889,67,7,Joey,"I'm only eating the skin, so the chicken's up for grabs."
890,68,0,Phoebe,"Ohh, okay, they gave you the old time pricing."
891,68,1,Rachel,Yeah.
892,68,2,Phoebe,"Well, what period is it from?"
893,68,3,Rachel,"Uh, it's from yore. Like the days of yore. Y'know?"
894,68,4,Phoebe,"Yes, yes I do."
895,68,5,Phoebe,"God, oh it's just perfect!"
896,68,6,Phoebe,I bet it has a great story behind it too.
897,68,7,Phoebe,Did they tell you anything?
898,68,8,Rachel,"Yes! That I know, this is from White Plains."
899,68,9,Phoebe,"White Plains. Oh, it sounds like such a magical place."
900,69,0,Monica,"Rachel, it's going to happen. Chandler is gonna move in here."
901,69,1,Rachel,But I
902,69,2,Monica,"No-no, wait!"
903,69,3,Monica,"Just let me finish, okay?"
904,69,4,Monica,"This isn't something that we just, we just impulsively decided in-in Vegas, this is something we both really want."
905,69,5,Monica,And it
906,69,6,Rachel,It is? Really?
907,69,7,Monica,"Yeah, sweetie."
908,69,8,Rachel,"I mean we're not, we're not gonna live together anymore?"
909,69,9,Monica,No.
910,69,10,Rachel,What? Oh my God! I'm gonna miss you so much!
911,69,11,Monica,I'm gonna miss you!
912,69,12,Rachel,I mean it's the end of an era!
913,69,13,Monica,I know!
