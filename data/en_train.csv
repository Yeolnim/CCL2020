1519,116,6,Phoebe,Exactly!,0
1520,116,7,Rachel,And you're gonna want him to eat his heart out so you're gonna have to look fabulous!,0
1521,116,8,Phoebe,"I didn't even think about that!  Aaargh,",0
1522,116,9,Rachel,"Hey Pheebs, I'm-I'm taking Charlie shopping, why don't you come and I'll help you find something.",0
1523,116,10,Phoebe,"Ok, that'll be great!",0

1530,117,3,Phoebe,"All I could think of was y'know, ""Is he gonna kiss me? Is he gonna kiss me?""",0
1531,117,4,Monica,And did he?,0
1532,117,5,Phoebe,"I'm a lady Monica, I don't kiss and tell. But this hickey speaks for itself.",1
1533,117,6,Monica,"Okay-okay, I got it. I got it.",0
1534,117,7,Phoebe,I just like him so much that I just feel like I've had 10 drinks today and I've only had six.,1
1535,117,8,Monica,"Oh, I haven't had that feeling since I first started going out with Chandler.",0
1536,117,9,Monica,"Wow, I'm never gonna have that feeling again, am I?",0
1537,117,10,Phoebe,You sound like a guy.,0
1538,117,11,Monica,"No, a guy would be saying, ""I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else.""",0
1539,117,12,Monica,Oh my God!,0
1540,117,13,Monica,I'm never gonna get to sleep with anyone else!,1

4160,309,15,Ross,"That ring? When my grandmother first came to this country, that ring and the clothes on her back were all she had with her.",0
4161,309,16,Chandler,"So you might say, the ring is irreplaceable?",1
4162,309,17,Ross,"Oh absolutely! It has been in my family for generations, and every bride who has worn it has had a long and happy life.",0
4163,309,18,Chandler,"So you might say, it's a magic ring.",1
4164,310,0,Ross,Well obviously only one of us can keep dating her.,0
4165,310,1,Joey,"Obviously! So, how do we decide?",0
4166,310,2,Ross,"Well now let's-let's look at this objectively, I think I should date her",0
4167,310,3,Joey,Uh-huh. Uh-huh.,0
4168,310,4,Ross,"That's interesting, but check this out. I date her",0
4169,310,5,Joey,Yeah-yeah I like that but just to go in another direction,0
4170,310,6,Ross,"Okay, okay. This can go on for a while.",0
4171,310,7,Joey,Yeah well we should order some food then.,1
4172,310,8,Ross,"No Joey! Look why don't, why don't we just let her decide? Okay? Hey-hey, we'll",0
4173,310,9,Joey,That sounds fair.,0
4174,310,10,Ross,Maybe I'll take her to that new French restaurant down the street,0
4175,310,11,Joey,Ah yeahwait a second now!,0
4176,310,12,Joey,Look we're gonna have to set a spending limit on the date.,0
4177,310,13,Joey,I don't have the money to take her to a fancy place like that.,0
4178,310,14,Ross,"Well sorry, that's what I do on dates.",1
4179,310,15,Joey,"All right, well I guess I'll just have to do what I do on dates.",1
4180,310,16,Ross,So let's decide on the spending limit,1
4181,310,17,Joey,"Yeah. Uh, a slicesix dollars?",1
4182,310,18,Ross,I was thinking more like a hundred.,0

4192,311,8,Joey,"Whew! Stood up to fast, got a little head rush.",0
4193,311,9,Monica,It's the heat.  And-and the humidity.,1
4194,311,10,Joey,"That's a uh, that's a tough combination.",0
4195,311,11,Monica,Do you wanna come in for some lemonade?,0

4208,312,10,Joey,I wasn't gonna walk all the way back down here with one shoe!,1
4209,312,11,Joey,I'm gonna go find that guy's car and leave a note on the windshield.,0
4210,312,12,Chandler,"Oh good, when he comes back for his keys, I'll be sure to give him your shoe.",1
4211,312,13,Joey,Great! Thanks.,0

4236,314,6,Monica,Okay!,0
4237,314,7,Phoebe,Okay.,0
4238,314,8,Monica,"Hello?  Oh yes, one minute please.  It's for you. It's the fire inspector.",0
4239,314,9,Phoebe,Oh!  Hello?  Yeah this is Phoebe.  Really?!,0
4240,314,10,Joey,"Yeah, so it turns out that it wasn't the hair straightener that started the fire.",0
4241,314,11,Joey,"No-no, it was the candles.",1
4242,314,12,Joey,It's very not good leaving candles unattended.,0
4243,314,13,Joey,"In fact, one of the first things they teach you in fire school is  Uhh Uhh Okay.",1
4244,314,14,Joey,"Well, I have to go now.",1
4245,315,0,Monica,Is he crazy?! You just had Ross’s baby!,0

4260,315,15,Rachel,"Yeah, I mean whatever.",1
4261,315,16,Monica,"Honey, the question is…do you really want to marry Joey?",1
4262,315,17,Rachel,"No. No, I don’t. Could you be a dear and go tell him?",1
4263,316,0,Phoebe,So-so you two were married huh? What happened? You just drift apart?,0

4274,317,1,Rachel,Fine.,0
4275,317,2,Rachel,"Fine, but I'll have you know that once I taught him that stuff he called me Fun Aunt Rachel.",0
4276,317,3,Rachel,And I loved being Fun Aunt Rachel but I'll go back to being Boring and Uncomfortable Aunt Rachel if that's what you want!,1
4277,317,4,Ross,"No that's not what I want. Uh, I'm glad you guys were bonding but I",0
4278,317,5,Rachel,"Look he doesn't have any brothers or sisters, somebody's gonna have to teach him this stuff!",0
4279,317,6,Rachel,And I haven't taught him anything that a normal 6-year-old doesn't know anyway!,0

4291,318,9,Chandler,"Oh that's all right, I have it memorized. It's 1A.",1
4292,319,0,Joey,You spent a hundred dollars. That's the limit. You're screwed!,0
4293,319,1,Ross,"Uh actually, I sent the flowers before the actual date. So technically,",0
4294,319,2,Joey,Oh-oh! So that's the way it's gonna be huh? Yeah I can break the rules too y'know!,0
4295,319,3,Ross,Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?,0

4308,320,4,Ross,"Dad, we-we can't believe you're selling the house.",0
4309,320,5,Mr. Geller,"Well, it's time for a new family to start their memories here and hopefully their check will clear before they find the crack in the foundation and the asbestos in the ceiling.",1
4310,320,6,Ross,Let's grab our stuff and get the hell out of here.,1
4311,320,7,Mr. Geller,I'm sorry we can't store your childhood things anymore.,0

4314,320,10,Monica,I used to,0
4315,320,11,Ross,"Yeah, not as much as you used to love to play uncooked batter eater.",1
4316,320,12,Monica,"Hey, it is unreasonable to expect a child to wait for a",0
4317,321,0,Ross,"Ok, got the vent open.",0
4318,321,1,Phoebe,"Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!",1

4326,321,9,Ross,"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!",0
4327,321,10,Janitor,Wait! You forgot your legs!,1

4329,322,1,Rachel,Thank you.,0
4330,322,2,Joanna,Filing system?,0
4331,322,3,Joanna,Oh-oh!,0
4332,322,4,Joanna,You mean those-those little colored labels you put on all the folders?,0
4333,322,5,Joanna,It certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets.,1
4334,322,6,Rachel,"Well, they uh, they-they do more than that.",1
4335,322,7,Mrs. Lynch,I notice that you've been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities.,0
4336,322,8,Rachel,"Yes, Joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me.",0
4337,322,9,Joanna,Oh. And Rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me. It's amazing how she gets it right almost,1
4338,322,10,Rachel,"I-I-I of course, I have more responsibilities than that.",0
4339,322,11,Joanna,"Oh yes, well there's the coffee too.  Rachel can carry two things at once!",1
4340,322,12,Mr. Posner,"Yes, that's very good. Now a uh, big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships, especially with designers.",0
4341,322,13,Rachel,"Yes, I realize that",0
4342,322,14,Joanna,"And Rachel shouldn't have any problem with that. The only problem might be getting a little too friendly, if you know what I mean.",1
4343,322,15,Rachel,I love working with designers!,0
4344,322,16,Joanna,"With them, under them, what's the difference? Eh, Rach?",0
4345,323,0,Monica,What happened in Atlantic City?!,0
4346,323,1,Ross,"Well, Chandler and I are in a bar",0
4347,323,2,Chandler,"Did you not hear me say, ""Du-ude?!""",1
4348,323,3,Ross,"And this girl is making eyes at Chandler, okay?",0
4349,323,4,Ross,"So after awhile he-he goes over to her and uh, after a minute or two, I see them kissing.",0
4350,323,5,Ross,"Now, I know what you're thinking, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls, and you're right, Chandler's not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls.",1
4351,323,6,Monica,You kissed a guy?!! Oh my God.,0
4352,323,7,Chandler,"In my defense, it was dark and he was a very pretty guy.",0
4353,323,8,Ross,"Oh Mon, I laughed so hard",0
4354,323,9,Chandler,"Ho-ho, so hard we had to throw out your underwear again?",1
4355,323,10,Ross,"Whatever dude, you kissed a guy.",0
4356,324,0,Rachel,"So umm, you're gonna stay with me as long as I need you?",0
4357,324,1,Mrs. Green,Of course I am!,0
4358,324,2,Rachel,"Oh mom, I swear I'm not an idiot.",0
4359,324,3,Rachel,"I've read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth, but I-I just didn't think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes.",1
4360,324,4,Rachel,And-and then guess what?,0
4361,324,5,Rachel,The baby's coming and I don't know what to do.,1
4362,324,6,Rachel,"Oh, can I throw up in my diaper genie?",1
4363,324,7,Mrs. Green,"No. Sweetie, you're gonna be fine.",0
4364,324,8,Rachel,Wait-wait where are you going? Where are you going?,0
4365,324,9,Mrs. Green,I'm going to the bathroom.,0
4366,324,10,Rachel,Okay.,0
4367,324,11,Mrs. Green,Now don't worry! Everything's gonna be okay.,0
4368,324,12,Monica,It,0
4369,324,13,Ross,Hey!,0
4370,324,14,Phoebe,Hey! Why are you all red and sweaty?,0
4371,324,15,Ross,I just Bamboozled Chandler!  Which is not uh sexual thing. That was a quick shower.,1
4372,324,16,Phoebe,Not if you were here.,0
4373,325,0,Monica,"Okay, the reason why I asked you guys out to brunch today is because I have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor.",0
4374,325,1,Rachel,Oh my God! This is it!   I really hope it's you!,1
4375,325,2,Phoebe,I hope it's you.,0

4377,325,4,Monica,"First of all um, I love you both so much and you're both so important to me",0
4378,325,5,Rachel,"Okay, bla-bla-bla-bla!! Who is it?!",1
4379,325,6,Monica,"Well umm, I was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other.",0
4380,325,7,Monica,"Like hypothetically, if Phoebe were mine",0
4381,325,8,Phoebe,Yes!!! Oh!!,0
4382,325,9,Rachel,Hypothetically!,0
4383,325,10,Phoebe,Still.,0
4384,325,11,Monica,If Phoebe were my maid of honor,0
4385,325,12,Monica,"Rachel would be Phoebe's, I would be Rachel's, that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset.",0
4386,325,13,Rachel,Yeah that's actually a pretty good idea.,0
4387,325,14,Phoebe,"Yeah, I'll do that. So who gets to be yours?",0
4388,325,15,Monica,"Well that's the best part. Umm,",0
4389,325,16,Phoebe,Wh-why is that the best part?,0
4390,325,17,Monica,Because then I don't have to!,0
4391,325,18,Rachel,Well of,0
4392,325,19,Monica,I'm really not deciding!,0
4393,325,20,Rachel,Fine!,0
4394,325,21,Phoebe,"Aww, and good luck to you too!  What a nice lady!",1
4395,326,0,Rachel,Joey? Could you get that?  What are you doing here? I thought you were in your room?,1

4399,326,4,Joey,"Well, half a brownie.",0
4400,326,5,Joey,"Actually, it's just bag.",0
4401,326,6,Joey,It's been a long walk from the flower shop and I was startin' to feel faint so,0
4402,326,7,Rachel,Oh man!,0
4403,326,8,Rachel,This is so great!,0
4404,326,9,Rachel,I actually feel like I'm going on a real date!,0
4405,326,10,Rachel,"Although, I have a hint of morning sickness, and I'm wearing underwear that goes up to aboutthere.",1
4406,326,11,Joey,"Hey come on now, this is a real date.",0
4407,326,12,Joey,"Uh, sonice place you got here.",0

4594,339,6,Phoebe,"Five? Okay, where am I giving birth, a hospital or a big box under the stairs?",0

5518,411,4,Ms. McKenna,You fell asleep?,0

6031,448,5,Joey,"Well okay, so then you're fine.",0
6032,448,6,Joey,The rule is when two actors are actually doing it off-stage all the sexual tension between them is gone.,0
6033,448,7,Joey,Okay?,0
6034,448,8,Joey,So as long as it's hot onstage you got nothing to worry about.,0
6035,448,9,Joey,"It's when the heat goes away, that's when you're in trouble.",1
6036,448,10,Chandler,Really?,0

6104,454,2,Chandler,"Look, don't you see what's happening here.",0
6105,454,3,Chandler,"Instead of hitting on her right away, he's becoming her confidant.",0
6106,454,4,Chandler,Now he's gonna be the guy she goes too to complain about you.,0
6107,454,5,Ross,What am I going to do?,0

6129,456,1,Chandler,"Oh, come on!",0
6130,456,2,Chandler,"Chandler's funny, sophisticated, and he's very loveable, once you get to know him.",1

6146,457,7,Mr. Geller,"You're independent, and you always have been!",0
6147,457,8,Mr. Geller,"Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine!",1
6148,457,9,Mr. Geller,"And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles...",0

6194,461,10,Joey,Yeah. Why are you getting so upset?,0
6195,461,11,Chandler,"Well, I'm upsetfor you. I mean, having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you.",1
6196,461,12,Joey,What is the big deal? It's not like we're exclusive.,0
6197,461,13,Chandler,"Look, Joey, Kathy is clearly not fulfilling your emotional needs.",0
6198,461,14,Chandler,"But Casey, I mean granted I only saw the back of her head, but I got this sense that she's-she's smart, and funny, and gets you.",1

6222,463,6,Ross,I like that.,1
6223,463,7,Emily,"Yeah? Listen closely, Devon has got a weak ankle.",0
6224,463,8,Ross,Huh?,0

6239,464,3,Chandler,And people say you don't pay attention.,1
6240,464,4,Chandler,"No, this is a much better job.",0

6242,464,6,Joey,Wow! How do you know how to do that?!,0
6243,464,7,Chandler,That's what I do now.,1

6699,497,1,Monica,"I know honey, I'm sorry.",0
6700,497,2,Rachel,"Oh, I wanna quit, but then I think I should stick it out, then I think why would such a person stay in such a demeaning job, just because it's remotely related to the field they're interested in.",0

7124,527,11,Emily,This is our wedding I'm talking about.,0
7125,527,12,Ross,The only thing I understand is postponing it is not an option. This is when we're getting married.,0

7131,527,18,Emily,It's you that is backwards.,0
